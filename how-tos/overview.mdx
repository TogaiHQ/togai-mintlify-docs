title: "How to use Togai - Showcases"
---



In this section, you can view our showcase videos on how to configure Togai for different pricing models and scenarios. We have taken the pricing models and values of various well-known brands and software products and configuring them within Togai. 

That's not all - we also have the added challenge of doing a **'Speed Run'** - we configure the pricing in Togai within the time it takes a song to play out. Using Togai is that easy!!!
