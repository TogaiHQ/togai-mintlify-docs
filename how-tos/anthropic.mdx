**Value metrics:** Per million tokens


[Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/) is an AI company that provides an LLM called [Claude](https://www.anthropic.com/). While Claude has a chat interface similar to ChatGPT, their primary monetization comes from their B2B offering which is accessed via APIs. Their pricing model is based a dollar figure per million tokens as can be seen [here](https://anthropic.com/pricing). In this video, Sajed and Adhitya from our team showcase how this can be easily configured in Togai before the song [Instant Crush](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5uQMwRMHcs) plays out.
