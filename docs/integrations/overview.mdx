Togai's integrations helps easily connect Togai with other business applications without writing a single line of code! This helps keep business applications in sync with Togai, and automate processes and workflows to save time on manual tasks.

Apart from using the pre-built apps & flows available in Togai's marketplace, Togai also provides the flexibility to create Flows (a sequence of actions) based on custom requirements of a business.

# Concepts

Before we dive into the details of how to use Togai's integrations, let's first understand some of the key concepts. Let's start with the building blocks of Togai's integrations - Apps and Flows.

## Apps

Apps are pre-built integrations that allows Togai to seamlessly connect with other business applications.

They offer **triggers**, which can be thought of as "cues" that prompt Togai to perform certain tasks. Triggers are essentially the events that Togai watches out for, and upon their occurrence, it initiates the predefined actions or workflows associated with them. 

They also offer **actions**, which are "do" part of the integration process, where Togai carries out a particular action based on a trigger or user input. 

### 1. Triggers  
Triggers in flows are the events that start the flow. They can be either an event in Togai or an event in an external app. App Developers define the list of triggers supported by the App.

For example, an external event could be a new customer created in Stripe, and an internal event could be an invoice generation event in Togai.

### 2. Actions  
Actions in flows are the tasks that are executed after a trigger event. They are executed in the order they are defined in the flow. They take input from the trigger and other actions in the flow and perform a specific task. Similar to triggers, App Developers define the list of actions that are supported in the app. 

For example, an action could be to create an invoice in Stripe, or update an account in Togai, or send a slack notification.

## Flows

Flows are a sequence of actions that are executed when a trigger event occurs. They can be used to automate processes and workflows. Most commonly required flows are already available in Togai's marketplace out-of-the-box and they can also be created based on custom requirements of a business.

### 1. Outbound Flows  
Outbound flows are those that start with a trigger event in Togai and then execute a series of actions in one or more external apps. 

For example, an outbound flow could be to create a new customer in Stripe, QuickBooks & send a slack notification when a new account is created in Togai.

### 2. Inbound Flows  
Inbound flows are the opposite of outbound flows. They start with an event in an external app, and then execute a series of actions. 

For example, an inbound flow could be to create a new account in Togai when a new customer is created in Stripe. Or, it could be to mark an invoice as paid in Togai when a payment is received in Stripe.

## Activity Logs

Activity logs are a record of all the runs that happened for an application. This includes the time at which flows were triggered, which actions were executed, and any errors that occurred. Logs provide visibility into the execution of flows, and identify any potential issues.
