The **Togai** and **Netsuite** Integration supports a bidirectional sync  Togai and Netsuite. This API guide will walk you through the steps to set up the integration, configure apps and flows, and enable automation for your business processes.

The integration between Netsuite and Togai requires only a one-time setup. Follow the steps below:

###  Installation of App Instances  
[](#installation-of-app-instances)  
   * Navigate to the Integrations section from the left navigation bar in Togai  
   * Click on `Apps` to access the list of apps with tight integration support  
   * Locate and select `Netsuite` from the available apps  
   * Click on the `+Add connection` button  
   * Provide a name for the connection and paste your `Netsuite API key` into the appropriate field

**_Repeat the same process for Togai, treating it as a separate App within the integration._**

  
**Note:** Togai is considered an app in our integration so it is easy for you to configure different keys for different flows. This way you can have specific permissions configured for a specific key, making it more secure. To create a secret key for Togai, go to the Admin Center on the left nav bar. Click on the API tokens tab. Then click on the ‘\`Generate new token\`’ button.
###  Triggers and Actions
[](#triggers-and-actions)  
There are 2 Actions and 1 Triggers available for Netsuite currently. The way it works is,

If `{trigger}`, then do `{Action}`

You can pick and choose the trigger and action that you want from the lengthy list available from all the applications. 

You can use these as building blocks to build your own flows.

An example flow would be: On creation of an invoice in Togai, create payment link Netsuite.
