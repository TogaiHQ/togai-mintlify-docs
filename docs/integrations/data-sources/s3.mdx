Amazon S3 is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance.

The integration between **Amazon S3** and **Togai** requires only a one-time setup. Follow the steps below:

## Install
* Navigate to the Integrations section from the left navigation bar in Togai
* Click on `Apps` to access the list of apps with integration support
* Select `S3` from the available apps
* Click on the `+Add connection` button 
* Provide a name for the connection and paste your:
    * `AWS Access Key ID`
    * `AWS Secret Access Key`

### AWS Access Key ID and AWS Secret Access Key

Create a new IAM user in your AWS account with access to S3 bucket that is going to act as your events object store and copy the `AWS Access Key ID` and `AWS Secret Access Key` from the `Security credentials` section of the user with following policy:
    ```json
    {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
            {
                "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Action": "s3:GetObject",
                "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::<S3_BUCKET_NAME>/*"
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

## Flows

### Import events from S3 Bucket 

#### Install

* Provide `Event Schema Name` corresponding to the events that are going to be imported from S3 bucket using this flow 
* Provide `Schema Mapping` as a JSON for the CSV files with default column names as the key and the corresponding CSV header as the value. The following is a sample schema mapping for reference:
    ```json
    {
        "accountId": "User Identifier",
        "id": "Event Id",
        "timestamp": "Event Time",
        "attributes.messageCount": "SMS Count",
        "attributes.mailCount": "Email Count",
        "dimensions.region": "Region"
    }
    ```
* On installation, the a webhook URL will be generated that needs to be configured as the S3 bucket notification destination for `s3:ObjectCreated:*` events. Refer to the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/NotificationHowTo.html) for more details on how to configure S3 bucket notifications.

#### Working

* The flow will be triggered when a new file is uploaded to the S3 bucket
* The new file created event will be used to generate a pre-signed URL for the file which will be used to download the file
* The pre-signed URL will be used to import the events from the file into Togai using the **Bulk Imports** feature which will be used to import the events into the corresponding event schema
* The imported events will be available in the **Events** section of Togai
* The status of the import will be available in the **Bulk Imports** section of Togai
