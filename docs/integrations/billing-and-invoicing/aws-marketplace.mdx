title: "AWS Marketplace"
---

Businesses using Togai can charge their customers using AWS marketplace with Togai's AWS marketplace integration. A business can create a product offering in AWS marketplace and add the list of products that they will be charging their customers. Price of these products can be configured as fixed fees or usage based fees in AWS marketplace.

Business can just send raw events to Togai and with AWS marketplace integration, Togai will periodically aggregate the data and ingest the metering into AWS marketplace based on the frequency supported by AWS marketplace. At the end of the billing cycle, AWS marketplace will charge the end customers with the aggregated usage and the granular raw events will be stored in Togai.
