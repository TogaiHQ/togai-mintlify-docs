Togai's integrations helps easily connect Togai with other business applications without writing a single line of code! This helps keep business applications in sync with Togai, and automate processes and workflows to save time on manual tasks.

Apart from using the pre-built apps & flows available in Togai's marketplace, Togai also provides the flexibility to create Flows (a sequence of actions) based on custom requirements of a business.

## Concepts

### Apps

Apps are pre-built integrations that allows Togai to seamlessly connect with other business applications.

They offer `triggers`, which can be thought of as "cues" that prompt Togai to perform certain tasks.  
Triggers are essentially the events that Togai watches out for, and upon their occurrence, it initiates the predefined actions or workflows associated with them. 

They also offer `actions`, which are "do" part of the integration process, where Togai carries out a particular action (such as creating invoices or updating accounts) based on a trigger or user input.

**1\. Triggers**  
Triggers are a type of an application action in Togai that are designed to start a flow when a specific event occurs.  
For example, a trigger could be a customer created event in Stripe, invoice generation event in Togai etc. App. developers define the list of triggers supported by the App.

**2\. Actions**  
Actions are designed to perform a specific task like create an invoice in stripe, update an account in Togai, send a slack notification etc. Similar to triggers, app developers define the list of actions that are supported in the app.

### Flows

Flows are a sequence of actions that are executed based on a trigger event.  
For example, when a new customer is added in Stripe, a flow can be set up to automatically create an account for the customer in Togai and send a slack notification. The flows are classified as:

**1\. Outbound Flows**  
Outbound flows are those that start with a trigger event in Togai and then execute a series of actions in one or more external apps.  
For example, a trigger event could be a new account creation in Togai, and the flow could automatically create a corresponding customer the account in Stripe, QuickBooks & send a slack notification.

**2\. Inbound Flows**  
Inbound flows are the opposite of outbound flows. They start with an event in an external app, and then execute a series of actions. This means that inbound flows can be used to automate tasks like creating a new account in Togai when a new customer is added in Stripe, or updating a usage meter in Togai.

### Activity Logs

Activity logs are a record of all the runs that happened for an application. This includes the time at which flows were triggered, which actions were executed, and any errors that occurred. Logs provide visibility into the execution of flows, and identify any potential issues.
