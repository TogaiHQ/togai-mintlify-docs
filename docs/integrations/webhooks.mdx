Webhooks are a way to receive updates from the server when something happens. For example, you can receive a webhook when a customer is created, or when an invoice is paid. This allows you to take action on your server when an event occurs on our side. 

## Supported events

The following events are supported by the Togai platform:
* Account creation
* Price plan creation
* Proposal creation
* Invoice updation
* Invoice generation
* Order generation
* Incident generation
* Report generation

## Creating a webhook

To create a webhook, you will need to create a private flow. You can do this by going to the Flows section of the **No-code center** and clicking on the **Create Flow** button.

1. Give your flow a name and description.
2. Choose flow type as **Outbound**.
3. Choose the **Togai** app as the Trigger and choose the event you want to receive a webhook for.
4. Choose the **Webhook** app as the Action and choose the **Initiate Webhook** action from the dropdown. Fill in the action payload for the action as:
    ```json
    {
        "payload": "request"
    }
    ```
6. Click on **Proceed** to create the flow.

This will create a private flow to receive webhooks for the event you chose. You can create a flow connection to get the events from the flow. 

## Enabling webhooks

Click on the **Add Connection** button to create a connection to the flow, so that you can receive webhooks for the event you chose. Under the **Flow Connections** section, you will be able to see the connection you just created.

## Debugging webhooks

You can debug the webhooks you receive by clicking on the **Flow Activity Logs** section of the flow. This will show you the logs of the flow on step level granularity.
