Add-ons allow you to define a variable for a one-off fee or creating licenses. For instance, add-ons can be used to apply one-time fees such as a Setup fee or define the number of seat based licenses a customer wishes to purchase.

Additionally, since the dollar value of these add-ons are only assigned while adding them to a price plan, the add-ons can be recycled with multiple values across different price plans.

#### To create an Add-On via the user interface:

1. Access the **Billable Items** option on the side menu.
2. Choose the **"Add-Ons"** tab.
3. Hit the **“+ New Add-on”** button.
4. Enter a name for the Add-On.
5. Choose the type of Add-On from the dropdown list  
   1. License - allows you to charge your customers based on the number of seats or licenses they require.  
   2. Fixed Fee - allows you to charge a standard fee, independent of usage components. For example, a platform fees of $2000.
6. Hit **“Create Add-on”** button.

Once the add-ons are created, you can access the Add-ons view to scan a list of All Add-ons.
