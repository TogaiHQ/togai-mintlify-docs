## Six-steps workflow

**1\. Events Schemas** \- Imagine the event schema to be your database where you'll store all the fields you require for pricing. There are two types of fields - Attributes and Dimensions. Attributes are the continuous variables that can store any range of numbered strings and dimensions are the categorical variable which will help you classify or group your entire data. Read more [here](/docs/event-schemas).

**2\. Billable Items** \- Here's where you define usage meters (aggregation functions/formulae to quantify your attributes), license fees, and add-ons. Read more [here](/docs/billable-metrics).

**3\. Price Plans** \- This module allows you to add rate cards tied to your event schema and usage meters. Read more [here](/docs/priceplan).

**4\. Customers** \- This module enables adding your clients and associating them with price plans. In the event that a client has multiple departments ties with you, you can define each such department as an account within the parent customer.

**5\. Events** \- This module shows a real time list of all processed, unprocessed and in-progress events. For more information, read [here](/docs/event-ingestion).

**6\. Invoices** \- This module shows the history of invoices for your customers as well as the ongoing billing cycle's invoice. Read more [here](/docs/invoices-1).
