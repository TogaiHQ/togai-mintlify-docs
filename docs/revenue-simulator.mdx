Numerous companies are now exploring usage based pricing models. A tool that provides pricing recommendations based on usage data and specific revenue objectives gives these companies a head start for their initial implementation of usage-based pricing.

Moreover, even for those companies that already have some form of usage tracking or usage-based pricing models, this tool is beneficial. It aids in refining and enhancing their pricing strategies by considering their desired revenue goals and certain limitations, aiming to pinpoint the most effective pricing model.
