## What is a purchase?

A purchase in Togai is the process of paying something upfront to get something in return. This something can be a one-time service, a subscription plan, an entitlement grant access or a credit grant that can be utilized later.

Purchase flow can be used if you need to get paid upfront for customer to get access to your product or service. In this case, you can create a purchase for a billing plan (one-time or recurring) or an entitlement plan and create a corresponding Order.

The order can be synced to your payment gateway provider (Stripe, Adyen etc.) and once payment is successfully completed for that order, the customer is issued the plan or the entitlement grant accordingly.

<Tip> This flow is not relevant if you only invoice your customers In Arrears or do postpaid billing. </Tip>
