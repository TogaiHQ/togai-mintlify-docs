### What are credits?

Credits are a form of value or financial incentive provided to customers by a business. They can be given in various forms, such as free usage units or a specific currency amount. 

In some cases, businesses offer customers the option to purchase credits upfront. This can occur when there is a direct cost associated with using the product or service. For example, if a customer anticipates a significant bill for using a particular service, they may want to negotiate a discounted price by purchasing credits in advance. These purchased credits can then be applied toward their future usage, effectively reducing their overall cost.

### Applying Credits

Credits can be applied at different levels to a customer. 

1. Applying directly to the entire invoice amount
2. Set credits at the line item level - like a specific addon, fixed fee, usage meter, license fee etc
3. Applying credits to all fixed fees, all licenses, all usage meters and so on.

### How to create and apply Promotional Credits?

* Navigate to the customer tab.
* Create a new customer or select an existing customer.
* Click on the account associated with the customer.

### Example Scenario:

there's a customer called John Wick who uses an application ChatPPT. For the billing period of August to Sept 1, this is what his invoice looks like:

Now you can go to the Credits tab and add a credit for the referral customer that John has brought in.

Let's add a credit of $50 USD to his invoice only on certain usage meters.

His credit has now been added.

The amount he will have to pay for this billing period will then be 100-50 = $50.
