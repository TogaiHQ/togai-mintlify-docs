title: "Price plan overrides"
---

Businesses that generate a high volume of transactions could demand a separate price based on their predicted volume of sales or revenue. This negotiation could happen between you, the business provider and the customer, and the decided price can be stored against the customer subscription.

These overrides are generally provided to acquire large enterprise customers and each customer will have their own pricing requirements on procurement. These deal details are not accessible for other customers and are bound by contract terms covering legal and privacy requirements. Your sales teams can utilize the Price Override feature to handle customer specific pricing for their customers.

Now on to how overrides work. 

1. Go to the plan you want to attach to an account and click on +Attach Plan to Account at the top
