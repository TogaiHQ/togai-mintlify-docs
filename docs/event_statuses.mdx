## INGESTION_IN_PROGRESS
1.  If the ingested event already exists and


        - if it is an entitled event,


            - if the status of the existing event is not IN_PROGRESS, we consider the ingested event as separate correction event and mark it as IN_PROGRESS


            - else we do an event sha check to check if event is a duplicate. If found duplicate we mark it as INGESTION_FAILED_DUPLICATE_EVENT else we process the existing event.


        - else
            - on idempotency check success, we mark event as IN_PROGRESS


            - else event is marked as INGESTION_FAILED_DUPLICATE_EVENT upon duplicate check


    else we mark it as IN_PROGRESS

## INGESTION_FAILED
1. If the event is not of internal schema type and if the attributes or dimensions are missing in the event.
2. On failure of getting the necessary details to process the events like schema, account etc.

## INGESTION_FAILED_SCHEMA_NOT_DEFINED
1. Upon processing an IN_PROGRESS event if the schema definition is not found
2. Upon processing an IN_PROGRESS event internal schema defined task like named_license, usage events, if the name of the internal schema is mentioned wrong

## INGESTION_FAILED_UNITS_INVALID
1. On computation of usage from matched usage_meters, if the json logic parsing, evaluation, big decimal conversion of usage_units fails

## INGESTION_COMPLETED_NO_MATCHING_METERS
1. In case of entitledEvent from IN_PROGRESS state, if the presence of usageMeter is not found before ingestion of the entitled event
2. In case of non named_license event, if there is no usage meters found.

## INGESTION_COMPLETED_EVENT_METERED
1. On succesful completion of named_license_event
2. On succesful insertion of usage_metadata for any other event than named_license_event

## INGESTION_COMPLETED_EVENT_NOT_METERED
1. If no usage_metadata is generated

## UNKNOWN
1. On failure of transformation of valid event status number to IngestionStatus 

## INGESTION_FAILED_ENRICHMENT_FAILED
1. For entitled event in IN_PROGRESS, if enrichment processing fails

## INGESTION_FAILED_PAST_GRACE_PERIOD
1. On processing an IN_PROGRESS event, if the ingestion_timestamp is more than the cycle end date plus grace_period

## INGESTION_FAILED_ACCOUNT_NOT_FOUND
1. If the process of getting account details fails as a part of processing IN_PROGRESS events

## INGESTION_FAILED_DUPLICATE_EVENT
1. If insertion of usage_metadata, usage_entries, usage_for_cycle results in EntityAlreadyExistsException

## REVERTED
1. For undo event corrections, in case of existing event status not in (IN_PROGRESS, INGESTION_FAILED_DUPLICATE_EVENT, INGESTION_FAILED_INSUFFICIENT_CREDITS, REVERTED)
2. For redo event corrections, in case of existing event status not in (IN_PROGRESS, INGESTION_FAILED_DUPLICATE_EVENT, REVERTED, INGESTION_FAILED_UNITS_INVALID, INGESTION_FAILED_PAST_GRACE_PERIOD)
3. For redo_event event corrections, in case of existing event status not in (IN_PROGRESS, INGESTION_FAILED_DUPLICATE_EVENT, REVERTED, INGESTION_FAILED_UNITS_INVALID, INGESTION_FAILED_PAST_GRACE_PERIOD, INGESTION_FAILED_ACCOUNT_NOT_FOUND)

## INGESTION_FAILED_NO_EVENT_ID
1. If event with no id is received and there is no eventIdTemplate or eventIdTemplate parsing fails

## INGESTION_FAILED_INVALID_NAMED_LICENSE_EVENT
1. On processing an IN_PROGRESS named license event, if the event is not a valid internal event type

## INGESTION_FAILED_INSUFFICIENT_CREDITS
1. On processing an IN_PROGRESS event, if the event is not entitled and the schema has feature_details we try to deduct wallet entries, on failure of deduct wallet entries we mark it as INGESTION_FAILED_INSUFFICIENT_CREDITS
