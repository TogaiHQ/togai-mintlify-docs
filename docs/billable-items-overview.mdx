title: "Billable Items Overview"
---

Billable items are value metrics (features, resource usage, seats, and other fees) that you want to charge your customers for. 

Billable items need to be created in 2 scenarios: 

1. If you want to charge your customers for the use of a particular resource/feature, then you should create the corresponding billable item.
2. You can also create billable items for resources you want to measure now but monetize later.

There are 3 types of billable items: 

1. **Usage Meters**: to define how you want to aggregate usage data
2. **Add-ons**: to set up flat fees, License fees or credits.
3. **Features**: to set up your product features and then create entitlements/ feature usage limits
