title: "Pricing cycle"
---

Pricing cycle is the first step to configuring your price plan. You can define the following entities in a pricing cycle - 

* **Plan type** - This defines your pricing model for this catalogue/contract. You can choose if this plan is meant for one-time purchase or a subscription. One-time purchases are meant for offerings like professional services, setup or onboarding fees where there is no recurring component associated with them. If you choose 'Recurring' type, you can model subscriptions under this setup. 

<Check>Usage based pricing would fall 'Recurring' since the customer has subscribed to use the service/product and will be invoiced as long as they end up consuming your product during the period of the contract.</Check>

* **Currencies** - Togai supports multi-currency rating by default. You can define the list of currencies your organization supports in the [Admin center](/docs/admin-center).

<Note>If you choose a one-time plan type, then the rest of the configurations in the Pricing cycle step would not be applicable.</Note>

* **Billing cycle** - You can choose whether you want the default billing cycle for the plan should be Weekly, Monthly, Quarterly, Half Yearly or Annual.

<Tip>We also provide 'Recurrence Interval' at a rate card level for you to manage different billing cycles for different line items within a single price plan. [Learn more](/docs/rate-cards#recurrence-interval)</Tip>


* **Anniversary cycle flag** - 

* **Cycle start date** - 

* **Grace period** - 

* **Deferred revenue computation** -
