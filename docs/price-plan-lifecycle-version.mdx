## Price plan lifecycle

* **Draft** - Price plans can be created in a draft mode. Draft mode is meant to be used when you want to create a test plan and edit it as required. You can add/edit/delete the configurations in a draft state. Price plans in draft mode cannot be associated with a customer account. You can also archive a plan that is in draft state. When you save a price plan in the draft state, its status will be shown as 'Inactive'

* **Active** - You can publish Price plans directly to create it in an 'Active' state. You can also toggle an 'Inactive' plan to an 'Active' state and vice versa. Currently, you cannot edit an Active plan. 

<Note>Active plans can be deactivated only if they do not have any customer accounts associated with them.</Note>

* **Archive** - You can archive an Inactive Price plan. Archived plans are not displayed in the dashboard but would still be stored within Togai.

<Info>You cannot delete Price plans from Togai currently. If you do have the need to delete a plan, please reach out to us and we can help you with it.</Info>
