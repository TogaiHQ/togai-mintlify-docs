title: "Invoices overview"

In a usage based pricing model, customers find it hard to predict their costs due to the variability in their usage. It is extremely important for customers to know their consumption data & patterns in real-time. Just showing usage metrics to customers is not sufficient. Customers need to be aware of their costs for the current cycle in real-time so that they can always keep track and not be surprised at the end of the cycle.

<Check>**Togai's invoicing system is intrinsically built to handle real-time rating and billing requirements to meet the above basic expectations of the customers.**</Check>

## How invoicing works?

Togai automatically generates invoices for each account/group based on the following - 

* Wait till end of grace period for a billing cycle
* List of rate cards in the price plan
* Usage quantity for each rate card
* Pricing model and type for each rate card to be applied to relevant usage slab
* Apply pricing rules
* Apply Credits and commitments
* Apply custom charges
* Manage tax, if applicable
* Calculate gross and net amounts and generate the final invoice based on the invoice template
* Automatically send the generated invoice to customers

## Invoice statuses

* **Ongoing** - This is the status of an invoice that has 'In Arrears' rate cards during the current billing cycle.
* **Due** - As soon as the grace period ends, the Ongoing invoice becomes 'Due'
* **Paid** - This is the status of an invoice for which payment has been received
* **Uncollectible** - If you have an invoice where you do not expect the customer to pay, you can mark the invoice as 'Uncollectible'
* **Void** - You can also cancel an invoice using this option

<Note>Paid and Void statuses are terminal states of an invoice and cannot be modified further. The rest of the statuses can be updated/modified depending on the scenarios and your actions.</Note>

## Invoicing features
As part of the invoice module, Togai provides additional capabilities.

* Invoice groups - [Learn more](/docs/invoice-groups)

<Tip>You can group invoice line items by adding tags to the rate cards in a price plan</Tip>

## Custom charges
This feature allows you to include additional charges in an upcoming or ongoing invoice. This feature enhances flexibility by allowing you to configure an additional value or a discount based on a computation on your existing line items in the invoice. You also have the option to choose if a custom charge should be counted for revenue or not.
