Select the **“Events”** tab on the side menu to view the list of events that have been triggered from your system to Togai.

The events ingested in Togai can have one of the following three states:  
**1\. Processed Events** \- This list details the lists of events that were successfully processed  
**2\. Unprocessed Events** \- This list contains the events that were not successfully processed by Togai  
**3\. In-Progress Events** \- This section lists the events that are currently in the queue waiting to be processed

To view the properties or the JSON Payload of any event, simply select the event and a summary will be displayed in a side panel on the screen.
