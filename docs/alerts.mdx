Togai supports the following types of alerts - 

* Usage based alert - this is an alert that is triggered when the custome crossed a certain usage value defined in this alert configuration.
* Entitlement alert - this alert is triggered when customer's entitlement balance drops below the defined theshold
* Credit balance alert - this alert is triggered when the customer's credit balance drops below a specified low balance threshold.

## Alert configurations

* Time interval - this allows you to set the frequency of checking if the alert condition has been met. The minimum interval is 30 minutes with increments of 30 minutes.
* Validity - You can also define a temporary alert that will check only for the duration of this validity period. If left empty, then the alert will be valid forever.

## Communication channels
You can configure multiple communication channels to a single alert. For example, if a customer crosses a usage threshold, you can intimate the same to both the customer via email as well as an internal slack channel for your accounts management team. Currently, Togai supports 3 channels - **Webhook, Email and Slack**
