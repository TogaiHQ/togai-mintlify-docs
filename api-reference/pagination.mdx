Togai's top-level API resources offer robust support for bulk fetching via the "list" API method. This method is applicable across various resource types including [customers](/api-reference/customers/get-a-customer), [accounts](/api-reference/accounts/get-an-account), [event schemas](/api-reference/event-schemas/list-event-schemas), [usage meters](/api-reference/usage-meters/list-usage-meters-for-event-schema), and [price plans](/api-reference/price-plans/list-price-plans). Regardless of the resource, these list APIs follow a common structure.

## Pagination Query Parameters

- **pageSize**: This parameter determines the number of results per page. Togai supports up to 100 results per page.
- **nextToken**: By providing a `nextToken`, you can retrieve a page of objects occurring immediately after the last object from the latest list.

<Note>
These list APIs accept few other query parameters to support Filtering, Searching and Sorting. Refer [Filtering, searching and sorting](/api-reference/filter-search-sort) page for more information on that topic.
</Note>

## Retrieving Results

The response from a list API represents a single page list of objects. If you do not input a `nextToken`, you will receive the first page of this stream.
The result contains `data` which is a list of requested entity objects and  `nextToken`

```json
{
    "data": [
        {...},
        {...},
        ...
    ],
    "nextToken": "eyJwYXlsb2FkIjp7ImlkIjoiY3VzdG9tZXIxMjMifSwicGFnZVNpemUiOjIwLCJxdWVyeUNvbnRleHQiOnsiZmlsdGVyQnkiOltbeyJmaXJzdCI6InN0YXR1cyIsInNlY29uZCI6eyJ0eXBlIjoiRVEifX0sWyJBQ1RJVkUiXV1dLCJzb3J0QnkiOnsiaWQiOiJBU0MifSwic2VhcmNoT24iOm51bGx9LCJ0b2tlblR5cGUiOiJORVhUIn0="
}
```

## Example Usages

### Retrieving first page of results

To list customers, make a GET request to the following endpoint:

```http
GET /customers
```

This request will return the first page consisting 20 of the customers along with a `nextToken`. If this is a last page, `nextToken` will be `null`.

<Note>
At times, the last page can return a non-null `nextToken`. This means, you will make one extra API call to receive an empty list with a `nextToken` as `null` to ascertain that you have read all of the results.
</Note>

### Limiting Results

If you'd like to limit the number of results per page, you can specify a `pageSize`. For example, to get only 10 results per page:

```http
GET /customers?pageSize=10
```

This request will return the first page of the customer list, with each page containing up to 10 customers.

### Retrieving next pages

To retrieve the next page of customers, you would include the `nextToken` obtained from the previous response:

```http
GET /customers?nextToken=eyJwYXlsb2FkIjp7ImlkIjoiY3VzdG9tZXIxMjMifSwicGFnZVNpemUiOjIwLCJxdWVyeUNvbnRleHQiOnsiZmlsdGVyQnkiOltbeyJmaXJzdCI6InN0YXR1cyIsInNlY29uZCI6eyJ0eXBlIjoiRVEifX0sWyJBQ1RJVkUiXV1dLCJzb3J0QnkiOnsiaWQiOiJBU0MifSwic2VhcmNoT24iOm51bGx9LCJ0b2tlblR5cGUiOiJORVhUIn0=
```

This request will retrieve the next page of customers after the last one from the first page.

<Note>
`pageSize` and other parameters passed to fetch the first page are not required to be passed in consecutive requests as this information is available within the `nextToken` and will be conidered when returning next pages.
