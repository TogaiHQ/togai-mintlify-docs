Togai API allows your application to push usage events and customer information to Togai UBP infrastructure. Learn more about Togai UBP from [here](https://www.togai.com/).

To integrate Togai into your application, you can use the JSON HTTP API or one of the Togai libraries. Our APIs are organized around [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) and have resource-oriented URLs, accept form-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, uses standard HTTP response codes, [authentication](/api-reference/authentication), and verbs.

#### Togai Environments ðŸ“’

You can use the Togai API in sandbox and production environments. The base URL of API requests determines whether the request is in sandbox mode or production mode.
