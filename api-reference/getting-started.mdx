Togai API allows your application to push usage events and customer information to Togai UBP infrastructure. Learn more about Togai UBP from [here](https://www.togai.com/).

To integrate Togai into your application, you can use the JSON HTTP API or one of the Togai libraries. Our APIs are organized around [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) and have resource-oriented URLs, accept form-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, uses standard HTTP response codes, [authentication](/api-reference/authentication), and verbs.
