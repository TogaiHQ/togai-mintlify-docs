Togai uses token based authentication to authenticate API requests.

#### Generating New API Keys 🔑

If this is your first time using Togai, you'll likely need to generate a new API key from your Togai web app, [API Tokens](https://app.togai.com/settings/api-tokens) screen. You can do this by navigating in web app ->

1. Click Settings
2. Click API Tokens
3. Generate your first API key! You can do this by clicking the big green button Generate New Token in the center.

You can create multiple API tokens. However, you should copy and store your Secret Key as each Secret Key can be retrieved only once when it is being created.

The Secret key is the Bearer Token used for authenticating your request. It is the token that is used for Authorization in the API request.
