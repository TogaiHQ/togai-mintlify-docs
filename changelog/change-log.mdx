## July 28th 2023:

- Credit grant rate card: Ability to configure recurring credit grants as part of price plan for a price.
- Orders: Initiating entitlement plan purchases will now create orders instead of invoices. Togai creates an invoice (convert order into invoice) once the payment is received against the order.
- Support for "recurrence interval" in fixed fee ratecard to support cases where the cycle of fixed fee cards is required to be longer than the price plan itself (in multiples of price plan).
    E.g: Usage must be charged on a monthly plan but fixed fees are to be paid once per quarter => Monthly plan with a fixed fee rate card having recurrence interval as 3
    0$ invoices will automatically be marked as paid there by auto confirming the purchases and granting corresponding entitlements.
    Invoice status revamp. We are moving to unified invoice statuses from having invoice status and payment status earlier.
