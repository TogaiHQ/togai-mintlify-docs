## History

**Line Item Level Promotional Credits**

- The Line Item Level Promotional Credits provide more flexibility in how credits are applied. Apply credits to individual entities (like a specific usage meter, a specific add-on, fixed fee etc), and not just broadly to the entire invoice.

**Credits**

- Your customers can now purchase credits upfront which entitles them to some usage of your product. So if you're thinking of discounts, reimbursements, promotions and so on - togai can handle it all for you.

**License pricing/ Seat based Subscription**

- Togai now has extensive support for license/seat based pricing models.

**Proration of Fixed fees**

- Togai now supports fixed fee proration. Users will have to pay only for the number of days they are on the plan, rather than entire pricing cycle. This means that the fixed fee will get reflected in revenue on a day to day manner. 


**Add custom charges to invoices**

- You can now add miscellaneous charges to an upcoming (one-off) or ongoing invoice.

**Private Apps & Flows**

- All users can create apps for their own flows. This particular app/flow will be visible only to that user.

**Price plan Versioning**

- Create newer versions of your existing live price plans using versioning. You can decide if you want to move all customers in the current version to the new one, only particular segments or none of them.

**Price Plan Scheduling**

- Togai now allows you to schedule (in the future) the association of a price plan to an account.

**Stripe integration**

- The Togai and Stripe Integration supports a bidirectional sync between Togai and Stripe.
Here are some flows that are possible today:
Some Available Flows:
Here are some examples of flows that you can utilize:

**Support for multiple currencies**

- Selling internationally and handling payments in different currencies? Do you have different pricing models and strategies for different regions and currencies? We're all set to handle them for you.

**Add minimum commitment fees**

- As a part of your contract, if you'd like to have a minimum fee that's chargeable from your customer if their projected usage target isn't met, you can now set that up in togai with just 2 clicks.

**Price plan overrides**

- On an account level, if you want to edit the configurations of a price plan (like adding a new fee, changing rate etc), you can do so using price plan overrides for an upcoming or ongoing cycles.

**Automated Invoice Generation**

- Based on your price plans, invoices are now automatically generated for your customers in real time. These can then be published to your accounting (Quickbooks, Zoho books) and payment (Chargebee, Paddle, Stripe etc) systems via our APIs.

**Add-ons/fixed fees**

- Togai now supports recurring flat fees. So if you monthly subscription fee or platform fee components, we got you.


**Sandbox environment**

- Take a tour of Togai using our no-login public sandbox. The whole experience is tailored to your role and industry and can give you an idea about what you can achieve with Togai

**Settings for orgs, customers and accounts**

- With Togai, you can create data fields on 3 levels: customer, account and organization level. You can then use the data in these fields for custom transformations and much more.

**Enriched values**

- Enrich events with extra metadata from other sources and price your products based on that. Provide customer level price customization, experiment with different pricing logic and much more with zero code changes.

**CSV Import of events, accounts and customers**

- Get started in minutes without developer effort by importing all your product's events, customers and accounts to Togai as a .csv file.
